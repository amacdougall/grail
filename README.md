# grail

A single-player MUD-like roguelike RPG. A fun project for playing around with
procedural generation and RPG tactics. Inspired by MUDs such as Avalon and
Achaea.

Below is the documentation from the re-frame template. It's not inaccurate, but
don't expect it to be relevant.

## Development Mode

### Compile css:

Compile css file once.

```
lein garden once
```

Automatically recompile css file on change.

```
lein garden auto
```

### Run application:

```
lein clean
lein figwheel dev
```

Figwheel will automatically push cljs changes to the browser.

Wait a bit, then browse to [http://localhost:3449](http://localhost:3449).

### Run tests:

```
lein clean
lein doo phantom test once
```

The above command assumes that you have [phantomjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/phantomjs) installed. However, please note that [doo](https://github.com/bensu/doo) can be configured to run cljs.test in many other JS environments (chrome, ie, safari, opera, slimer, node, rhino, or nashorn).

## Production Build


To compile clojurescript to javascript:

```
lein clean
lein cljsbuild once min
```
